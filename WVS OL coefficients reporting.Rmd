*A cross-national comparison, adjusted for educational attainment and relgious service attendance*

*Higher coefficients indicate a stronger relationship between right-wing economic ideology and higher levels of racial resentment (and between left-wing economic ideology and lower levels of racial resentment)*

*Method: Ordinal logistic regression*

# Create racial resentment factor variable

## Modeling

lapply(country_list, function(x) {
  model <- polr(RacRes ~ ec_ideo + edu + relig, data = x, weights = S017, Hess = T)
  return(data.frame(Coefficients = model$coefficients[1]))
}) %>% 
  do.call(rbind.data.frame, .) -> coeff.tab

POLR.tab <- coeff.tab[order(coeff.tab$Coefficients, decreasing = T), , drop = F]
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
kable(POLR.tab)
```
